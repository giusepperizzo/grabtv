It is intended to replace Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport, and to become the single commercial airport serving Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg, an area with a combined 6 million inhabitants. It is named after Willy Brandt. Originally planned to be opened in 2010, Berlin Brandenburg Airport has encountered a series of delays due to poor construction planning, management and execution. As of March 2013, it is not known when the airport will be inaugurated, though any dates prior to 2014 have been discarded. Due to these problems, the initially stated construction budget will be greatly exceeded. Air Berlin and Lufthansa (including its Germanwings subsidiary) are expected to become the leading carriers at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, both having announced the intent to set up a hub operation there. EasyJet is thought to become the third largest tenant. With a projected annual passenger number of around 27 million, Berlin Brandenburg would become the third busiest airport in Germany and one of the fifteen busiest in Europe.",

In total, some  of concrete were used and  of temporary access roads, nineteen new road bridges and a network of approximately  of permanent roads were built."

        "dbpedia-owl__abstract": "Berlin is the capital city of Germany and one of the 16 states of Germany. With a population of 3.5&nbsp;million people, Berlin is Germany's largest city and is the second most populous city proper and the ninth most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the River Spree, it is the center of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 4½ million residents from over 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. First documented in the 13th century, Berlin was the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), the German Empire (1871–1918), the Weimar Republic (1919–33) and the Third Reich (1933–45). Berlin in the 1920s was the third largest municipality in the world. After World War II, the city became divided into East Berlin—the capital of East Germany—and West Berlin, a West German exclave surrounded by the Berlin Wall from 1961–89. Following German reunification in 1990, the city regained its status as the capital of Germany, hosting 147 foreign embassies. Berlin is a world city of culture, politics, media, and science. Its economy is primarily based on the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, media corporations, and convention venues. Berlin also serves as a continental hub for air and rail transport, and is a popular tourist destination. Significant industries include IT, pharmaceuticals, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, electronics, traffic engineering, and renewable energy. Berlin is home to renowned universities, research institutes, orchestras, museums, and celebrities, as well as host of many sporting events. Its urban settings and historical legacy have made it a popular location for international film productions. The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, public transportation networks and a high quality of living.",

The last words were, \"Take care and good luck. \" Radio Berlin International broadcast in many languages, with many of its announcers at the different services &amp;mdash; such as English, French and even Danish &amp;mdash; coming from their country's respective communist parties.

He has a sharp humor, a bitter sarcasm, and at the same time towards women a gentle, special smile.\"",

        "dbpedia-owl__abstract": "Luis Buñuel Portolés (22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a Spanish filmmaker who worked in Spain, Mexico and France. When Luis Buñuel died at age 83, his obituary in The New York Times called him \"an iconoclast, moralist and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later. \" His first picture—made in the silent era—was called \"the most famous short film ever made\" by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film—made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel's work \"the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality,... scandalous and subversive. \" Often associated with the Surrealist movement of the 1920s, Buñuel created films in six decades, from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and nearly every film genre, including experimental film, documentary, melodrama, satire, musical, erotica, comedy, romance, costume dramas, fantasy, crime film, adventure, and western. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, \"Buñuel nearly always made Buñuel films. \" Six of Buñuel's films are included in Sight &amp;amp; Sound's 2012 critic's poll of the top 250 films of all time. 14 of his films are included in They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? list of the 1000 greatest films of all time, which is tied with Jean-Luc Godard for third most, and he ranks number 14 on their list of the top 250 directors.",
